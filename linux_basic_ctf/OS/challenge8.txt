🎯 Challenge 8: Extract the Right Field

You've been given a file called `data.csv`.  
It's structured like a table with 4 columns:
`id,name,email,flag`

Most of the rows have "none" in the flag column.  
But one row… has the real flag.

🕶️ Your mission:
- Use the `awk` command to extract the **4th column** from the file.
- Scan through the output and spot the flag.

📌 Rules:
❌ Do NOT use `cat`, `grep`, or open the file manually.  
✅ Use ONLY the `awk` command.
