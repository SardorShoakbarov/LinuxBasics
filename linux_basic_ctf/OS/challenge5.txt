🔐 Challenge 5: Permission Denied

You’ve found the flag... or so you thought.

The file `flag.txt` is right there — but you can’t read it.  
Access is denied. The system is blocking you.

🕶️ Your mission:
1. Use `ls -l` to check the file permissions.
2. Use the `chmod` command to give yourself read access.
3. Use `cat` to read the flag.
