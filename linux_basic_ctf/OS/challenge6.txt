🎯 Challenge 6: Spot the Difference

Two files are inside this folder:  
`fileA.txt` and `fileB.txt`

At first glance, they look the same.  
But one of them hides a secret — a flag.  
The difference is small... but real.

🕶️ Your mission:
- Use the `diff` command to compare both files.
- Find the line that is different and contains the flag.
- Print that flag to the screen.

📌 Rules:
❌ Do NOT open the files using `cat`.  
✅ ONLY use the `diff` or `diff -c` command.
