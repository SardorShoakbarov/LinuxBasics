🎯 Challenge 4: Scan the Logs

There are 10 log files in this directory.  
Each contains normal text — except one.  
Only one file holds the hidden flag.

🕶️ Your mission:
- Use the `grep` command to search for the line that contains the flag.
- The flag is in this format: `FLAG{...}`

📌 Rules:
❌ Do NOT open files one by one.  
✅ Use ONLY the `grep` command.
