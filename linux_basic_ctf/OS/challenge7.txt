🎯 Challenge 7: Echo the Secret

You've been given a file called `note.txt`.  
It looks harmless... but you're about to upgrade it.

🕶️ Your mission:
- Add a secret message to the file using the `echo` command.
- The message must be exactly: FLAG{echo_is_powerful}
- Use `>>` to **append** the message (not overwrite).

📌 Rules:
❌ Do NOT open or edit the file manually.  
✅ Use ONLY the `echo` command.
